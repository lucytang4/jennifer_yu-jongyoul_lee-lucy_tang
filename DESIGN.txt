PROJECT DESCRIPTION
    Recreation of the game Blackjack
    RULES: https://www.pagat.com/banking/blackjack.html
    Casino style with players vs dealer.
    For the players to win, its a team effort. The dealer must have more losses than wins total by the end of the round.
    NO money involved, just a win count and loss count.

USER INTERFACE
    There will be at least 2 players: 1 dealer, 1 challenger
    All cards are dealt randomly (limited to one or more decks depending on number of players)
    Each player takes a turn, until all the players have been served.
    The dealer reveals both of his cards.
    The dealer must draw if his cards total below 17.
    The players are sent the results of their individual game.
    And then they are sent the overall results of the round.

TECHNICAL DESIGN
    Memory allocation
    Writing and Reading information from files: keep track of moves
    Networking: Server is the dealer and clients are the players
    Semaphores: control the amount of players
    Shared Memory: keep track of the cards used
    Signals: quit game
    
DATA STRUCTURES
    Some kind of queue for each players' turns
    
ALGORITHMS
    Client-Server Handshake to manage first connection
